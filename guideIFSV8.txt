	1 Governance and commitment
	1.1 Policy
	

	1.1.1*
	The senior management shall develop, implement and maintain a corporate policy, which shall include, at a minimum:
• food safety, product quality, legality and authenticity
• customer focus
• food safety culture
• sustainability.
This corporate policy shall be communicated to all employees and shall be broken down into specific objectives for the relevant departments.
Objectives about food safety culture shall include, at a minimum, communication about food safety policies and responsibilities, training, employee feedback on food safety related issues and performance measurement.
	An IFS Fact Sheet from IFS is available on food safety culture.
Planning to improve the culture of food safety is fundamental. This plan should be based on analysis.
Each department should know its contribution through goals, core values and actions.
In particular, the personal contribution of the company’s management is crucial.
The EU Regulation prescribes an obligation of the entire staff to the safe production and distribution of food.
The company‘s policy can also be called core values, values or core rules.
	• With which persons was the company policy developed?
• How do you keep policies up to date?
• When and how did you last personally convince the company‘s management of the awareness and effectiveness of the policy?
• How do you ensure the commitment to safe production and distribution as part of the food safety culture?
• How did you communicate policy to everyone in the company?
• What activities has the company‘s management personally carried out to promote the food safety culture?
• For which core contents of the policy have you set concrete goals?
• What are the departments‘ goals for
• food safety, product quality, legality and authenticity
• customer focus
• food safety culture
• sustainability?
	To be able to confirm the senior management statements, it makes sense to follow up on the requirements of chapter 1 in the last third of the audit.
• Politics
• Goals per area, bonus system if applicable, measures to achieve the goals, notices
	Major: Policy not developed
by the company’s management
No targets set on the points of policy

	1 Governance and commitment
	1.1 Policy
	

	1.1.2002
	All relevant information related to food
safety, product quality, legality and
authenticity shall be communicated
effectively and in a timely manner to
the relevant personnel.
	

	• How is relevant information forwarded
to relevant persons?
• What was the last relevant piece of
information that was distributed in the
company?
• How are those responsible for the
different areas of law determined?
• What sources do you use to keep
yourself up-to-date?
• How is implementation ensured?
	• Legal cadastre
• Information regarding changes
or innovations
	Major: There is a security
or legality problem
since information is not
communicated within
the company.

	1.2 Corporate structure
	

	KO N°1
1.2.1*
	The senior management shall ensure
that employees are aware of their
responsibilities related to food
safety and product quality and that
mechanisms are implemented to
monitor the effectiveness of their
operation.
Such mechanisms shall be clearly
identified and documented.
	This point is linked to the
organizational liability of the
company management: The company
management can be held liable
for the actions of third parties if the
delegation of tasks was illegal or
contrary to the articles of association
or grossly violates the interests of the
company. It is also liable for its own
fault in the selection, guidance and
supervision of persons.
	• Which methods (e.g. target/actual
comparison of maintenance,
laboratory analyses, training,
corrective actions, ...) do you use to
determine the effectiveness?
• How do you proceed in the event of
deviations?
• What are some examples of
deviations?
• Do all employees have an up-to-date
job description?
• At what intervals does the company‘s
management monitor which points?
• How did you document the
„mechanisms“?
	• Description of the mechanisms
of the line
	KO: The company’s
management does
not guarantee that
employees know and
implement their
responsibilities.
The control activities
(ensures) are only
rudimentary.
People are not aware of
their responsibilities
and this leads to a
problem of food safety
and/or legality (e.g.
through misconduct).
The mechanisms are not
comprehensibly or the
IFS requirements are
frequently not adhered
too.
	5
	1 Governance and commitment
	1.2 Corporate structure
	

	1.2.2002
	The senior management shall provide
sufficient and appropriate resources
to meet the product and process
requirements.
	A rough planning of the tasks and
analyses (e.g. audits and laboratory
analyses) is available.
A budget or cost plan is available.
The plan considers human resources.
	• Have all product and process
requirements been fully implemented
in the last year?
• Are all the necessary measures being
implemented on time?
• Have you budgeted for resource
requirements?
• How do you determine resource
requirements?
• How do you deal with bottlenecks?
	• Budget or cost planning
• Human resources with sufficient
qualification
	Major: When the
company‘s management
does not provide enough
resources, and this leads
to a problem with food
safety and/or legality.
	6
	1 Governance and commitment
	1.2 Corporate structure
	

	1.2.3*
	The department responsible for food safety and quality management shall have a direct reporting relationship to the senior management. An organisational chart, showing the structure of the company, shall be documented and maintained.
	In addition to the organizational chart, a list of officers (e.g. food defence, HACCP team leader, data protection, safety specialist, etc.) is also required.
There are regular meetings between quality departments and the company management.
	• How are the product safety and quality departments connected to the company‘s management?
• To whom do QM and QA report?
• How often do consultations with the company management take place?
• Is there an organizational chart?
• How is the organization structured?
• What powers do the QM and QA departments have?
	• Organigram
• Lists of representatives
	

	7
	1 Governance and commitment
	1.2 Corporate structure
	

	1.2.2004
	The senior management shall ensure that all processes (documented and undocumented) are known by the relevant personnel and are applied consistently.
	Core processes are described or comprehensible through descriptions.
The requirements for the activities and their monitoring are taught as part of the training.
Employees are also familiar with the requirements for product safety: GHPs, oPRPs and CCPs. In particular, the monitoring of control measures is well known.
	• How do you communicate the requirements for the processes to your employees (including temporary and seasonal staff)?
• How do employees know the criteria for the processes?
• In which cases do you create written specifications and when do you rely on familiarization/training?
• What happens in case of violations?
• What are the results of the monitoring?
• What criteria are used to monitor the processes?
	• Employees‘ knowledge of the requirements for their activities
• Processes, briefings
	Major: Employees have little knowledge of the process, and this leads to a problem of food safety and/or legality and/or serious quality problems that are not related to
a specific contracted customer requirement.
	8
	1 Governance and commitment
	1.2 Corporate structure
	

	1.2.5*
	The senior management shall maintain a system to ensure that the company
is kept informed of all relevant legislation, scientific and technical developments, industry codes of practice, food safety and product quality issues, and that they are aware of factors that can influence food defence and food fraud risks.
	At regular meetings, the status of new and applicable laws or regulations is discussed in the leadership round. If a company cannot do this itself, external services may be used.
	• How does the company‘s management ensure that relevant food safety laws are known?
• Which sources are used for this?
• For which legal changes have you received feedback on the effective implementation?
• How does management ensure that purchased products comply with all relevant legislation?
• How does the company‘s management ensure that the manufactured products comply with the relevant legislation?
	• Legal changes and their timely implementation
• Examples of legal changes and their sources of information
• Information system (incl. factors on food defence and fraud risks)
• Food defence plan
• Food fraud vulnerability assessment
	Major: Lack of legal knowledge and information about the relevant laws leads to a problem of food safety and/or legality.
	9
	1 Governance and commitment
	1.2 Corporate structure
	

	1.2.6*
	The senior management shall ensure that the certification body is informed of any changes that may affect the company’s ability to conform to the certification requirements. This shall include, at a minimum:
• any legal entity name change
• any production site location change.
For the following specific situations:
• any product recall
• any product recall and/or withdrawal decided by authorities for food safety and/or food fraud reasons
• any visit from authorities which results in mandatory action connected to food safety, and/or food fraud
the certification body shall be informed within three (3) working days.
	The supervising responsibilities cannot be delegated. The management has the obligation to ensure compliance.
Extraordinary circumstances shall be reported to the certification body, as soon as possible to foster a trusting relationship.
	• Is it clearly defined in which cases the CA must be informed?
• When would you have the last reportable changes or incidents?
• What points did your food control point out?
• What incidents related to product safety have there been?
• Were these reportable incidents?
• How is management involved in the assessment of incidents?
• In which cases does the company‘s management monitor compliance with the three days?
	• Overview of recalls and how to proceed
• Reports of the competent authority since the last visit
• Official documents which proof the registration of a company
• Process descriptions for the specific situations
• Management review
	Major: If the certification body has not been informed about e.g.
• an important change
• legal action against the company
• recall

	1 Governance and commitment
	1.3 Management Review
	

	1.3.1*
	The senior management shall ensure that the food safety and quality management system is reviewed.
This activity shall be planned within a 12-month period and its execution shall not exceed 15 months. Such reviews shall include, at a minimum:
• a review of objectives and policies including elements of food safety culture
• results of audits and site inspections
• positive and negative customer feedback
• process compliance
• food fraud assessment outcome
• food defence assessment outcome
• compliance Issues
• status of corrections and corrective actions
• notifications from authorities.
	The company‘s management carries out the review based on and in consultation with the respective experts on these points.
The review is communicated to the leaders.
The review should take place no more than 4 to 6 weeks after the end of the financial year and should not primarily be tailored to the audit date.
The management schedules the review in advance.
	• Based on what information did the company‘s management carry out the review?
• At what assessment level do you take action?
• When did the company‘s management carry out the review?
• Which group of people actively participated in the review?
• What conclusions (need for action or opportunities) were drawn based on the review?
• Which group of people was informed about the review and the measures taken?
	• Review and no descriptions, completeness of the review
• Measures based on the review
• People involved in the review
• Activities of the company‘s management
• Check for plausibility with the findings of the audit
	Major: There is no review by the company’s management, which has an influence on food safety.
	11
	1 Governance and commitment
	1.3 Management Review
	

	1.3.2002
	Actions from the management review shall be aimed at supporting improvement. The management review shall assess follow-up actions from previous management reviews and any change that could affect the food safety and quality management
system. The management review shall be fully documented.
	Based on the reviews, improvement measures (opportunities) and, if necessary, corrections or corrective actions are taken. These are planned with responsibilities, deadlines and resource requirements.
	• What actions have you taken based on the reviews?
• How did you plan these measures?
• What is the effectiveness of the measures taken in the previous year?
• How was the status monitored during the year?
• What improvements have been identified and what improvements have been achieved?
	• Measures from the previous year and from the current year
	Major: No measures will be taken for identified vulnerabilities, which may result in a food safety risk.
	12
	1 Governance and commitment
	1.3 Management Review
	

	1.3.2003
	The senior management shall identify and review (e.g. by internal audits or on-site inspections) the infrastructure and work environment needed to ensure food safety, product quality, legality and authenticity, at least once within a 12-month period, or whenever significant changes occur. This shall include, at a minimum:
• buildings
• supply systems
• machines and equipment
• transport
• staff facilities
• environmental conditions
• hygienic conditions
• workplace design
• external influences (e.g. noise, vibration).
Based on risks, the results of the review shall be considered for investment planning.
	Based on the analyses and review, there is a risk-based investment plan for the next few years. It is possible to see the planned service life of technical components/equipment.
If required, the analysis of the hygienic conditions also includes a consideration of the air exchange (x to y) per hour.
	• Which group of people carries out which part of the review?
• What are the criteria on which the condition assessment and evaluation are based?
• How are the results of the technical inspections included in the review?
• What inspections are planned?
• Does the technology record the condition of the infrastructure during inspections?
• How often are these checks performed?
• When did management deal with the results?
• Are there also inadequate evaluations?
• Are investments planned on this basis?
• Were the investments implemented on time?
• Based on which principles do they determine the hygienic conditions and the other aspects?
• How do you set priorities for investment planning?
• What are the necessary investments for the near future?
• Which group of people will be informed about the results of the review?
• How do you classify the risks for the derivation of investments?
• What is the investment volume based on these valuations?
	• Investment plan (risk-oriented)
• Check for plausibility with the findings of the audit
• Derivation of risk for investment planning
	Major: The infrastructure has not been evaluated and there is a security, quality and legal risk of products.
The working environment was not reviewed and there is a safety, quality and legal risk of products.

	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.1 Quality management
	2.1.1 Document management
	2.1.1.1
	A procedure shall be documented, implemented and maintained
to control documents and their amendments. All documents which are necessary for compliance
with food safety, product quality, legality, authenticity and customer requirements shall be available in their latest version. The reason for any amendments to documents, critical to those requirements, shall be recorded.
	Electronic approvals and the release of master data changes, for example, must also be taken into account in this procedure.
An indication of the change made is not a reason for the change. One reason or cause for a change could be, for example, new legal limits or technological changes.
	• How is it ensured that only valid documents are in circulation?
• Which documents are classified as critical for stating reasons of change?
• Are reasons for change or changes indicated (reasons for change are required)?
• What types of documents have you defined (e.g. policies, processes, procedural instructions, work instructions, forms, ...)?
• What criteria do you have for the different language levels?
• How do you check the that documents are comprehensive?
• Who checks the technical content of the documents?
• Who is allowed to release documents?
• How are employees informed about document changes?
• How is the distribution of the documents to the appropriate persons planned and organized?
• Are there distribution specifications (users of the document)?
	• Overview of documents and associated attachments
• Procedures
• Distribution lists
• Review of examples
	Major: Documents are not available and this endangers the legality, safety or quality of the product.
Invalid or obsolete documents are not marked as such and thus the legality, safety, quality or customer requirements are not guaranteed.

	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.1 Quality management
	2.1.1 Document management
	2.1.1.2
	The food safety and quality management system shall be documented, implemented and maintained and shall be kept in one secure location. This applies to both physical and/or digitally documented systems.
	The description of the system is easy to comprehend and avoids ambiguities (check with online tools).
	• Who can access which documents?
• How do you check for ambiguity in texts?
• Have you established criteria to avoid ambiguity of documents (e.g. are certain formulations, such as timely, defined or generally prohibited)?
• How do employees know which documents apply to them?
• Are there distribution lists?
• Where are the documents for the late shift kept?
• How do you obtain documents in the event of a power failure?
	• Documents
• Distribution specifications
• Document management system
• Procedure for document control
	Major: Documents will not be kept up-to-date and therefore not met with customer specifications.
Major: When there is no system for quality assurance and food safety in place.
	16
	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.1 Quality management
	2.1.1 Document management
	2.1.1.3*
	All documents shall be legible, unambiguous and comprehensive. They shall be available to the relevant personnel at all times.
	For clarity, the language level of the employees should also be taken into account (A1/A2 (elementary language use), B1/B2 (independent language use) to C1/C2 (competent language use)). Literacy of the workforce.
	• How can employees access the documents without a PC?
• How do employees know which documents apply to them?
	• Amended documents
	Major: The documents are not understood by the employees and there are significant
discrepancies. As a result hazards cannot be excluded.
	17
	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.1 Quality management
	2.1.2 Records and documented information
	2.1.2.1
	Records and documented information shall be legible, properly completed and genuine. They shall be maintained in a way that subsequent revision or amendment is prohibited. If records are documented electronically, a system shall be maintained to ensure that only authorised personnel have access to create or amend those records (e.g. password protection).
	In the event of an erroneous statement, the value is kept. But in addition, the correct value is noted with sign and dates.
	• What types of records/documented information exist?
• Are there any contractual obligations regarding archiving?
• What are the requirements for the storage of electronic data?
• Are records received via email? How is this data organized?
• When is data deleted?
• Are the records/documented information readable?

• Was there any data loss? What is the procedure for data loss?
• How are PDF files protected from manipulation?
• How should changes to records and documented information be carried out and marked? Who is authorized to make changes and how are changes to be reviewed and, if necessary, approved?
	• Archiving requirements
• Access and edit rights to data
	Major: Records are insufficient or non- existent and thus the legality, security or quality cannot be guaranteed.
Records are illegible and therefore there is no evidence of legally required surveillance.
	18
	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.1 Quality management
	2.1.2 Records and documented information
	2.1.2.2*
	All records and documented information shall be kept in accordance with legal and customer requirements. If no such requirements are defined, records and documented information shall be kept for a minimum of one year after the shelf life. For products which have no shelf life, the duration of record and documented information keeping shall be justified and this justification shall be documented.
	Especially in the case of electronic data, a regular check to restore of legacy systems is good practice.
	• Where are records and documented information stored?
• Who stores it?
• Who has read and write permissions?
• How long are records and documented information kept?
• On what basis were the retention periods determined?
• Has the storage period been set differently for products with a short shelf life?
• Is it specified which data, records or documented information are not to be archived?
	• Records (also at the end of the retention period)
• Procedure documents
• Justification for duration of record keeping
	Major: Documents are not stored in accordance with legal and customer requirements.

	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.1 Quality management
	2.1.2 Records and documented information
	2.1.2.3
	Records and documented information shall be securely stored and easily accessible.
	This also applies to electronic records. Public drives and drives without controlled access rights are not suitable for this. Data collection in Excel lists without protection or encryption is not a secure file format. A history of the data change should be visible.
	• Which data/recordings can be easily changed?
• Where do you store data?
• How do you check the possibilities of manipulating data?
• Have you defined this in your IT access rights system?
• Is compliance with access rights verified?
• How and when are access rights adjusted when changing jobs?
	• Access right overview
• Review of examples
	Major: Records cannot be found, therefore the safety, legality or quality cannot be guaranteed.
	20
	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.2 Food safety management
	2.2.1 HACCP plan
	2.2.1.1*
	The basis of the company’s food safety management system shall be a fully implemented, systematic and comprehensive HACCP based plan, following the Codex Alimentarius principles, good manufacturing practices, good hygiene practices and any legal requirements of the production and destination countries which may go beyond such principles. The HACCP plan shall be specific and implemented at the production site.
	A detailed HACCP plan allows the company to demonstrate that it has evaluated all aspects to ensure the production of safe and legal food. The original HACCP plan must be updated if the processes are changed. Records of the results of monitoring, verification and validation shall be kept.
	• What changes have been made recently?
• How are new processes released? (have hazards been analysed?)
• Were there any technical changes?
• Are there any new raw materials?
• How many HACCP plans exist? (every site an individual one)
• What specific regulations and limits are considered in the HACCP plan?
• What specific legislation is included in the HACCP plan?
• Are the legal requirements of the target country - in particular the labelling requirements - considered in the HACCP plan?
	• HACCP plan
• Structural and technical changes
• GMPs
• GHPs
• Changes in production and cleaning procedures
	Major: A HACCP plan is missing.
Legal requirements are not included in the HACCP plan.
The HACCP plan copied from another location, without necessary adjustments results in hazards.
The HACCP plan is severely outdated and current hazards are not sufficiently addressed.
	21
	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.2 Food safety management
	2.2.1 HACCP plan
	2.2.1.2*
	The HACCP plan shall cover all raw materials, packaging materials, products or product groups, as well as every process from incoming goods up to the dispatch of finished products, including product development.
	The HACCP plan should also pay close attention to outsourced processes.
	• Does the HACCP plan cover all product groups, processes including product development and product packaging?
• Which processes are considered?
• Are samples and their production also considered?
• How are outsourced processes considered in the HACCP plan?
	• HACCP Plan
• Product group overview
• Flow chart
• Review of examples from on-site evaluation
	Major: The HACCP plan does not cover all product groups and processes, which jeopardizes food safety.
	22
	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.2 Food safety management
	2.2.1 HACCP plan
	2.2.1.3
	The HACCP plan shall be based upon scientific literature or expert advice obtained from other sources, which may include: trade and industry associations, independent experts and authorities. This information shall be maintained in line with any new technical process development.
	Up-to-date information on hazards can be found at the RASSF portal or in the IFS login area.
Technical progress must be taken into account, especially in the case of detectors (metal detector or X-ray machine) (e.g. How long will the data be stored or can data be stored?).
Where applicable, regulatory requirements supersede requirements of the standard. For example related to Canadian and US law, certain forms and formats are required.
	• How do you inform yourself about the state of the art and the applicable legal aspects?
• How do you evaluate or determine the state of the art of the control measures?
• Is the HACCP plan based on scientific literature or technically verified specifications for the manufactured products and processes?
• How do you deal with new technical developments?
• Does the HACCP system meet all applicable legal requirements of the country in which it was introduced, including the necessary and applicable risk assessments and documentation?
	• Reference of used literature, trade and industry associations, experts and authorities
• Modernization of equipment if necessary,
• Evaluation of the technical infrastructure with regard to control measures
	Major: The HACCP plan is not based on scientific literature or technically verified data on products and processes and this endangers food safety or it will violate applicable law.
	23
	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.2 Food safety management
	2.2.1 HACCP plan
	2.2.1.4
	In the event of changes to raw materials, packaging materials, processing methods, infrastructure and/or equipment, the HACCP plan shall be reviewed to ensure that product safety requirements are complied with.
	The use of new raw materials (e.g. non-organic) or production on new plants must not take place without an analysis of the hazards and the assessment of their risk.
All employees who are authorized to make changes are aware that they must be communicated in such a way that a new assessment of the HACCP plan is possible before the affected product is placed on the market.
Good practice: There is a change history.
	• What were the conclusions of the hazard analyses?
• How do you assess new threats?
• How is the timely communication regarding changes ensured?
• How is ensured that all changes are communicates to everyone affected?
	• Changes and their timely consideration in HACCP
	Major: Changes will not be included in the HACCP system in time, a food safety risk exists.
	24
	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.3 HACCP analysis
	2.3.1 HACCP team
	2.3.1.1
	Assemble HACCP team:
The HACCP team shall have the appropriate specific knowledge and expertise and be a multidisciplinary team which includes operational staff.
	It makes sense to involve production, purchasing, logistics, sales, QA and, if necessary, QM.
Monthly to quarterly HACCP team meetings are common. The frequency should be recorded.
	• Who is in the HACCP team?
• Which departments/functions are represented in the HACCP team?
• How was the qualification for membership in the HACCP team checked?
• Was an external HACCP expert consulted?
• How often does the HACCP team meet?
• Which hazards have been discussed in the last meeting?
• What measures has the HACCP team taken recently to improve product safety?
	• Overview of the HACCP team
• Appointment of the HACCP team (date),
• Protocols from the HACCP team
• Service contract
• Training evidence
• Proof of professional experience
	Major: There is no HACCP team or it is not active and the hazards are not addressed.
Although there is a lack of product knowledge, no external expert has been consulted and this results in food safety and legal risk.
	25
	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.3 HACCP analysis
	2.3.1 HACCP team
	2.3.1.2
	Those responsible for the development and maintenance of the HACCP plan shall have an internal team leader and shall have received appropriate training in the application of the HACCP principles and specific knowledge of the products and processes.
	The HACCP team leader should have access to sufficient resources.
It is good practice to have a refresher training for the HACCP team members every 2 to 3 years.
	• Are there different HACCP training courses (in-depth training for the HACCP team and HACCP basic training for employees)?
• When did the last HACCP training take place?
• Who took part in the HACCP training?
• How is the success of the training determined?
• How has the management been trained?
• Where did you obtain your professional expertise?
	• HACCP training proof
• Last training of the HACCP team
	Major: The HACCP team does not have the necessary knowledge of HACCP and does not understand the basic principles of the Codex Alimentarius and the hazards are not sufficiently addressed.

	2.3 HACCP analysis
	2.3.2 Product description
	2.3.2.1
	A full description of the product shall be documented and maintained and shall contain all relevant information on product safety, which includes, at a minimum:
• composition
• physical, organoleptic, chemical and microbiological characteristics
• legal requirements for the food safety of the product
• methods of treatment, packaging, durability (shelf life)
• conditions for storage, method of transport and distribution.
	When it comes to temperature specifications, a distinction must be made between limit value and guideline value. Particularly in the case of non-refrigerated products, max. temperatures and possible durations (e.g. transport by container overseas) must also be considered.
	• How did you structure your product descriptions?
• Are there different product descriptions for external persons (e.g. customers) and for internal persons (e.g. production)?
• Is there a complete product description for each product?
• How are changes justified?
• What is included in the product description?
	• Product description
• Specifications
• Manufacturing instructions
• Recipes
• Verify with information on product and packaging
	Major: Product descriptions are missing which results in an insufficient demarcation of the hazards.
Essential product data is missing from the product descriptions.
The essential information does not comply with the legislation (e.g. microbiological test values).

	2.3 HACCP analysis
	2.3.3 Identify intended use and users of the product
	2.3.3.1
	The intended use of the product shall be described in relation to the expected use of the product by the end consumer, taking vulnerable groups of consumers into account.
	The YOPIS are to be considered for their intended use. YOPIS refers to
„Young“, „Old“, „Pregnant“ and
„Immunosuppressed“ – i.e. risk groups in terms of illness and nutrition.
	• What is the intended use of the product?
• For which group of consumers is the product unsuitable?
• Is the product suitable for children, pregnant women, or the elderly?
• How are the special requirements for risk groups determined?
	• Intended use of the products
• Requirements for sensitive consumer groups
	Major: It is not specified for which group of people the product is suitable/not suitable and the product is commonly consumed by vulnerable groups.
The intended use is not defined and misuse results in hazardous situations.

	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.3 HACCP analysis
	2.3.4 Construct flow diagram
	2.3.4.1
	A flow diagram shall be documented and maintained for each product, or product group, and for all variations of the processes and sub-processes (including rework and reprocessing). The flow diagram shall identify every step and each control measure defined for CCPs and other control measures. It shall be dated, and in the event of any change, shall be updated.
	IFS follows the definitions laid down in the Codex Alimentarius.
However, for the EU market the EU HACCP guideline may be applied i.e., control measures include the PRPs, oPRPS and CCPs.
Control measures (e.g. heating) are not monitoring measures (e.g. temperature measurement).
The EU HACCP guideline also lists waiting times as necessary for the flow charts.
	• Are flow diagrams available for all products?
• Are the flow diagrams dated?
• Are all CCPs labeled in the flow diagram?
• Is the material flow fully described (e.g., also waste, discard from metal detectors, rework, ...)?
	• Flow diagrams
• Review of examples
	Major: Flow diagrams are not available for some of the products and thus a food safety risk exists.
	29
	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.3 HACCP analysis
	2.3.5 On-site confirmation of the flow diagram
	2.3.5.1
	Representatives of the HACCP team shall verify the flow diagram through on-site verifications, at all operation stages and shifts. Where appropriate, amendments to the diagram shall be made.
	Before verifying the flow diagrams for all operating times (e.g. break times without staff or cleaning of the adjacent line) and operating stages (e.g. production and cleaning), it makes sense to clarify these times.
	• Based on which criteria are the flow diagrams checked?
• How did you determine the times and operating levels for the review?
• What conclusions did you draw from examining the flow diagrams?
• What happens if you identify deviations or new hazards when checking the flow diagrams?
	• Test results and their criteria
• Meeting minutes
	Major: An on-site inspection or verification of the flow diagrams was not carried out and the hazards are not sufficiently controlled.

	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.3 HACCP analysis
	2.3.6 Conduct a hazard analysis for each step
	2.3.6.1
	A hazard analysis shall be conducted for all possible and expected physical, chemical (including radiological and allergens) and biological hazards. The analysis shall also include hazards linked to materials in contact with food, packaging materials as well as hazards related to the work environment. The hazard analysis shall consider the likely occurrence of hazards and the severity of their adverse health effects. Consideration shall be given to the specific control measures that shall be applied to control each significant hazard.
	The hazard analysis is carried out with implemented preventive programs. In addition, operational peculiarities (e.g. permanent structural challenges or temporary measures, etc.) should be taken into account in the risk analysis in order to demonstrate that the situation has been explicitly assessed in advance.
When it comes to food contact material, attention must be paid to the hazards that can arise from the product, chemicals (e.g. does the material match the chlorine cleaner?) and the temperatures used (e.g. the plastic is still compliant even at 120°C), at all stages of production. An analysis of the hazards from the working environment (e.g., Listeria spp.) must also be carried out at each stage of the process.
The hazard analysis should furthermore include consideration of the permissible foreign contamination in the raw materials and products.
	• Is there a hazard analysis for each step and an assessment of its risks?
• Does it include every possible and expected hazard?
• What biological, physical, radiological, allergenic and chemical hazards can be expected?
• When did you identify hazards on site?
• Is there a risk analysis for all product groups with an indication of severity and probability?
• Are complaints and incidents taken into account in the hazard analysis?
• Is the risk increased in the event of increased incidents?
• Is the risk assessment based on the EU Notice (C355)?
• Are hazards that only occur seasonally also identified?
• Which preventive measures (GHP or PRPs) have been identified and how are they monitored?
	• Hazard analyses for each process step
• Risk assessment
• Overview of contact material,
• Hazard analyses for the working environment and contact material
	Major: Essential steps are missing from the analysis and the hazards are not properly assessed, which results in a high risk for the product safety.
Significant hazards were not considered.

	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.3 HACCP analysis
	2.3.7 Determining critical control points and other control measures
	2.3.7.1
	Determining whether the step at which a control measure is applied is a CCP in the HACCP system shall be facilitated by using a decision tree or other tool(s), which demonstrates a logical reasoned approach.
	Codex Alimentarius that a decision tree is one possible option.
In the EU HACCP guide an example decision tree is provided.
An alternative would be a double risk assessment (e.g. without and with oPRPS/ CCPs)
	• What tool for CCP determination are you using?
• What conclusions do you draw from the tool of your choice?
• How do you determine oPRPs?
• Which CCPs have been defined?
• How many CCPs exist?
• Can the defined CCPs influence the process to prevent, eliminate or reduce a food safety hazard?
• What other control measures have been established?
	• Hazard analysis
• Flow diagram
• HACCP system
• Tool to determine CCPs
	Major: The decision tree for defining a CCP was used incorrectly, resulting in a control measure not being defined as a CCP. For this reason, the necessary monitoring was not defined for the control measure and a food safety cannot be ruled out.
	32
	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.3 HACCP analysis
	2.3.8 Establish validated critical limits for each CCP
	2.3.8.1*
	For each CCP, critical limits shall be defined and validated to identify when a process is out of control.
	The evidence (validation) for each CCP must be demonstrated. Worst-case scenarios (e.g. highest germ load and lowest permissible temperatures) are the focus of the evidence.
Description of critical limits according to EU Notice C355: Critical limits correspond to the extreme values acceptable with regard to product safety. They separate acceptability from unacceptability. They are set for observable or measurable parameters which can demonstrate that the critical point is within critical limits. (…)
	• How did you determine the critical limits?
• Are the critical limits clearly defined (e.g. less than or less/equal to, greater than, greater/equal to …)?
• Do the critical limits include observable limits?
• Is there at least one critical limit defined for each CCP?
• What critical limits are defined?
• Do the critical limits include measurement tolerances?
• How were the critical limits validated?
	• HACCP system
• Overview of CCPs with critical limits
	Major: There are no critical limits for each CCPs. The critical limits are insufficiently defined, contradict the legal requirements, or are not validated. As a result a food safety risk cannot be excluded.

	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.3 HACCP analysis
	2.3.9 Establish a monitoring system for each CCP
	KO N°2.3.9.1*
	KO N° 2: Specific monitoring procedures in terms of method, frequency of measurement or observation and recording of results, shall be documented, implemented and maintained for each CCP, to detect any loss of control at that CCP. Each defined CCP shall be under control.
Monitoring and control of each CCP shall be demonstrated by records.
	Without identifying a possible loss of control, the monitoring procedures cannot be fully defined. Monitoring procedures do not always have to be measurable. For example, a visual sieve inspection is also a permissible procedure by means of observation.
The loss of control should be determined before placing on the market. The intervals of the monitoring must be adhered to.
	• What possible loss of control has been identified?
• Is every possible loss of control monitored?
• How are CCPs monitored?
• Did you have a loss of control at a CCP?
• How are losses of control recorded and assessed?
• How is the monitoring of each CCP documented? (date, time, signature responsible person, measured value)
• Who is responsible for the documentation?
• How long are the records kept?
• Where are the records kept?
	• HACCP plan with the CCPs and their monitoring
• CCP records (paper or electronic)
• Process description on the implementation of controls
	KO: CCPs are not monitored, and measurements are not documented.
Loss of control of a CCP is not immediately responded to with a corrective action.
It is not clear from the records who, when and where an action was taken, or what results it led to.
Records are not retained for a reasonable period.
The legal requirements related to the CCP records are not met.

	Records of CCP monitoring shall be verified by a responsible person within the company and maintained for a relevant period.
	Archiving times may be diverging e.g., for X-ray machines and metal detectors.
Records are controlled in such a way that the company can react in the event of an error before the products reach the market.
	• Who is responsible for reviewing CCP monitoring records?
• When how and who checks the results of the monitoring?
• How long are CCP surveillance records kept?
	• CCP Records
	Major: CCP monitoring records are not reviewed by a responsible person in the company and/or are not retained for a relevant period.

	The operative personnel in charge of the monitoring of control measures defined for CCPs and other control measures shall have received specific training/instruction.
	The employees master the controls securely. There are enough trained employees to cover vacation times, different shifts and sick days.
The limit values and the procedure for deviations should be known.
	• Which persons or functions supervise which control measures
• How are the training/instruction planned?
• What training or instruction is provided to monitor the control measures (e.g. for the GHPs/PRPs, oPRPs and CCPs)?
• When do these trainings or briefings take place?
• Are all supervisors trained/instructed?
• Is a sufficient number of employees trained?

	• Who is responsible for monitoring other control measure records?
• Where and how did you set up monitoring?
	• Description of the monitoring of all control measures

	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.3 HACCP analysis
	2.3.10 Establish corrective actions
	2.3.10.1
	In the event that the monitoring indicates that a particular control measure defined for a CCP or any other control measure is not under control, corrective actions shall be documented and implemented. Such corrective actions shall also take any action relating to non-conforming products into account and identify the root cause for the loss of control of CCPs.
	Monitoring shall be understood as defined in Codex Alimentarius (The act of conducting a planned sequence of observations or measurements of control parameters to assess whether a CCP is under control).
This is enlarged to other control measures as well in IFS.
According to EU HACCP Guide C355, corrective actions go towards the process for the CCP and towards the process for the oPRP.
A good root cause analysis is hardly possible without one or more established methods (e.g., 5W, fishbone diagram/Ishika diagram, fault tree analysis, …).
	• What are the corrective measures for each CCP?
• When were corrective actions taken?
• Where are the corrective actions documented?
• Who documents the corrective actions taken?
• How is the effectiveness of corrective actions taken evaluated?
• Have the causes of the corrective actions occurred repeatedly?
• Has management been informed of ineffective corrective actions at the CCP?
	• HACCP
• CCP records
• Evidence of corrective action
• Process description for monitoring activities
• Root cause analysis for loss of control of a CCP
• Actions regarding the non-conforming product
	Major: Corrective actions on deviations/ non-conformities are not defined nor implemented.
The corrective actions are incomprehensible.

	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.3 HACCP analysis
	2.3.11 Validate the HACCP plan and establish verification procedures
	2.3.11.1
	Procedures of validation, including revalidation after any modification that can impact food safety, shall be documented, implemented and maintained to ensure that the HACCP plan is suitable to effectively control the identified hazards.
	

	• How do you validate CCPs or other relevant control measures?
• How do you determine the objectives/ acceptance criteria of the validations?
• Which group of people will be informed about the results of the validation?
• Is this group of people sufficiently qualified for this?
• How do you derive frequency of re-validation?
	• Planning of validation (procedures and methods)
• Change management
• Validation protocol
	Major: After processes were changed, validations are not planned, carried out and the effectiveness of the control measures is not guaranteed. Thus a food safety risk cannot be excluded.
	39
	2 Food safety and quality management system
	2.3 HACCP analysis
	2.3.11 Validate the HACCP plan and establish verification procedures
	2.3.11.2*
	Procedures of verification shall be documented, implemented and maintained to confirm that the HACCP plan is working correctly. Verification activities of the HACCP plan, for example:
• internal audits
• testing
• sampling
• deviations and non-conformities
• complaints
shall be performed at least once within a 12-month period or whenever significant changes occur. The results of this verification shall be recorded and incorporated into the HACCP plan.
	Verification procedures should include specific criteria. Without criteria (e.g. completeness of CCP readings), objective verification is not possible.
	• How were you trained for verification activities?
• How do you ensure sufficient qualification?
• How often is the HACCP plan verified?
• Are the verification criteria defined?
• What were the results of the last verification?
• Have all control measures been verified?
• Is the company‘s management informed in case of insufficient verification results?
• How do you evaluate the verification results?
• What would be actions in case of poor results?
	• Verification report of the HACCP plan
• Verification results of all CCPs
• Evaluation of the completed verifications and evaluation of the hazard control
	Major: No verification is carried out and this leads to a safety risk.

	3.1 Human resources
	

	3.1.2001
	All personnel performing work that affects product safety, quality, legality and authenticity shall have the required competence, appropriate to their role, as a result of education, work experience and/or training.
	The minimum competence of temporary workers and external workers should also be audited here. Do temporary workers have the same competence (e.g. for short-term assignments on a line or on a CCP)? Are the temporary workers aware of the control measures and their limits?
	• How is it ensured that new staff is fully suited to the tasks?
• Who determines the necessary competence?
• Have you considered exceptions?

Assignment of key roles shall be defined.
	Good job descriptions include tasks, responsibilities, powers, and duties, as well as requirements for the job and deputies.
	• For which positions are there written job descriptions?
• What is the content of the job descriptions?
• For which positions are there (no) job descriptions?
• How did you design the job descriptions for the managers and for the temporary staff?
• What is regulated in the job descriptions?
• Do deputies have the same powers?
• Are the job descriptions given to the employees?
• How are job descriptions adjusted when changing jobs?
	• Responsibility description for important key staff “dedicated to a specific person”, e.g. QA manager, production manager, shift leader

be available for laundries. The standard is based on the idea of establishing a system of preventive measures in the cycle. This is done in the same way as the HACCP!
If the clothes are washed by your own staff, temperatures, handling and detergent should be specified.
	• How is the protective clothing washed?
• Do you have different cleaning requirements (e.g. for the clothing of the technology)
• Are there people who wash their protective clothing at home?
• Is the washing of the protective clothing based on a risk analysis?

The company shall have a risk assessment in place where activities, which are critical to food safety and product quality shall be audited more frequently. It shall also apply to off-site storage locations owned or rented by the company.
	In addition to the requirements of the standard, the requirements of the customer contracts should also be considered in the internal audits.
It is good practice for internal audits to not only the provide the IFS audit checklist to the internal auditor, but a document with indications on good practice, sample questions and elements to check.

• raw materials
• semi-finished products (if applicable)
• finished products
• packaging materials
• contact surfaces of processing equipment
• relevant parameters for environmental monitoring.
All test results shall be recorded.
	Environmental monitoring is a process to assess how effectively the site is being constructed, maintained, and cleaned to prevent microbiological contamination. It typically means monitoring various surfaces (e.g., cutting blades, tables, conveyers) for pathogens (e.g., listeria, salmonella) and spoilage organisms. The goal is to determine whether any pathogens or spoilage organisms are present in the environment and to respond accordingly if a positive result is found.
We expect that the monitoring parameters from the process environment (e.g., bacteriological self-monitoring of the surfaces) are
established based on a risk assessment that considers the full range of products and relevant microbiological organisms. This form of monitoring concerns most food production sites, especially those areas where products are open or ready-to-eat products are produced.
If the environmental monitoring is considered as not required, the assessed site shall demonstrate that based on its legal/science-based risk assessment. This risk assessment shall consider the site’s whole product range and relevant microbiological organisms.
